            <h2>Guidelines for Developers</h2>
            <p>Developers play a crucial role in ensuring ethical practices in software development. Some key guidelines for developers include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Privacy and Data Security: Developers should prioritize user privacy and data security. They should follow best practices for encryption, secure coding, and data protection (IEEE Code of Ethics).
               <li>Transparency: Developers should be transparent about how data is collected, used, and shared. Users should have clear information about what happens to their data (ACM Code of Ethics).
</li>
                <li>Inclusivity and Accessibility: Developers should strive to create inclusive and accessible software that can be used by people with disabilities and diverse backgrounds (ACM Code of Ethics).

            <h2>Ethical Considerations for Data Scientists</h2>
            <p>Data scientists must consider various ethical principles in their work, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Informed Consent: Data scientists should ensure that data is collected with informed consent whenever possible, and individuals should be aware of how their data will be used (Data Science Association's Code of Professional Conduct).</li>
                <li>Data Privacy: Data scientists should handle sensitive data with care, following data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA, and take measures to anonymize or pseudonymize data (Data Science Association's Code of Professional Conduct).</li>
                <li>Bias and Fairness: Data scientists should be vigilant about identifying and mitigating biases in data and algorithms that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes (European Union's AI Ethics Guidelines).</li>
            </ul>
